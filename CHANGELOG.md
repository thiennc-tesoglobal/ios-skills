# Changelog

## v1.0.0-community

### New skills

- Add `ios-app-workflow` for end-to-end app and feature delivery with scoped specialist routing, behavior-preserving structure guidance, and evidence-based verification.

### Skill updates

- Streamline ten core Swift, SwiftUI, persistence, accessibility, testing, and Simulator entrypoints around clear scope boundaries and progressive disclosure.
- Add project-structure and file-naming guidance to `swiftui-patterns`.
- Standardize local Agent Skills eval files on the documented `assertions` field.

### Repository

- Register the new workflow in `ios-engineering-skills` and `all-ios-skills`, and update the public catalog count to 87.
- Publish community marketplace and Tessl metadata under Thien Ngo and `thiennc-tesoglobal/swift-ios-skills-community`.
- Preserve the original PolyForm Perimeter license and required copyright notice.

## v3.9.1

### Repository

- Bump the Tessl plugin and Claude Code marketplace metadata to 3.9.1.
- Add focused Agent Skills and Tessl regression coverage for synchronous Swift
  parallel-for review guidance.

### Skill updates

- Correct `swift-concurrency` guidance for measured, synchronous CPU-bound
  `DispatchQueue.concurrentPerform` loops: treat task groups as an async design
  alternative rather than a drop-in replacement, confine any
  `nonisolated(unsafe)` opt-out to audited local base-pointer bindings, and
  require concrete bounds, aliasing, initialization, lifetime, cancellation,
  serial-equivalence, and nested-parallelism checks.

## v3.9.0

### Repository

- Bump the Tessl plugin and Claude Code marketplace metadata to 3.9.0.
- Complete fresh Tessl quality reviews for all 86 skills and bring every content, description, and validation score to 100.
- Validate the remediated bundle locally with Agent Skills structural checks, reference checks, plugin linting, JSON parsing, and diagnostic-helper regression tests.

### Skill updates

- Refine 44 skills for stronger progressive disclosure, less duplicated guidance, clearer activation descriptions, complete operational workflows, and explicit validation and recovery checkpoints.
- Migrate `metrickit` to the iOS/iPadOS 27 beta `MetricManager` async report APIs while retaining an explicit iOS 26 `MXMetricManager` compatibility path and refreshing related boundary evals.
- Correct fast-moving framework guidance across EnergyKit, EventKit, AlarmKit, HealthKit, App Store metadata, AccessorySetupKit, SensorKit, PermissionKit, and related Apple platform skills.
- Add focused references for Core Data persistent history and staged migration, iOS memgraph reachable growth, App Clips size and promotion constraints, accessibility nutrition labels, and other progressively disclosed workflows.

## v3.8.0

### Repository

- Bump the Tessl plugin and Claude Code marketplace metadata to 3.8.0.
- Add paired Agent Skills audit coverage and promote focused Tessl scenarios for ETTrace comparison contracts and zero-leak persistent heap growth.

### New skills

- `ios-ettrace-performance` — reproducible ETTrace launch/runtime capture, exact-build dSYM UUID matching, processed flamegraph JSON analysis, inclusive/exclusive hotspot interpretation, and comparable verification runs.
- `ios-memgraph-analysis` — unambiguous Simulator memgraph capture, leak and retain-cycle ownership evidence, reachable heap-growth investigation, raw Apple-tool artifact preservation, and same-flow verification.

### Skill updates

- Refine `app-intents` triage to start from high-value actions outside the app, decide inline completion versus app handoff, share domain services across variants, and centralize runtime routing before selecting a system surface; move Siri, widget, Control Center, and Spotlight examples into a directly routed reference for progressive disclosure.
- Sharpen `debugging-instruments` routing so interactive Memory Graph and generic Instruments triage stay in scope while explicit `.memgraph` ownership/growth analysis and ETTrace work dispatch to their focused skills.
- Distill the remaining portable Build iOS Apps guidance into existing owners: dependent App Intent options and intentional defaults, behavior-preserving SwiftUI refactor boundaries with build/preview proof, and evidence-ranked SwiftUI performance remediation that avoids generic `@State` caching or blanket `equatable()` advice.

### Bundle changes

- Add `ios-ettrace-performance` and `ios-memgraph-analysis` to `ios-engineering-skills` and `all-ios-skills`.
- Update the complete bundle and public catalog count from 84 to 86 skills.

## v3.7.0

### Repository

- Bump the Tessl plugin and Claude Code marketplace metadata to 3.7.0.
- Add focused local Agent Skills eval coverage and promoted Tessl scenarios for SwiftUI view decomposition, preview isolation, and scroll-driven reveal surfaces.

### Skill updates

- Expand `swiftui-patterns` with concrete view-decomposition signals, focused value/action interfaces for narrowing Observation dependencies, and an explicit distinction between file organization and dedicated `View` boundaries.
- Add isolated preview-construction guidance covering deterministic loaded, loading, empty, and error states; complete required dependency installation; in-memory persistence; and avoidance of live services, authentication, production data, keychain state, and global singletons.
- Route advanced cancellation, debounce, clocks, `AsyncSequence`, and actor-isolation details from `swiftui-patterns` to `swift-concurrency`.
- Add paged primary/detail reveal guidance to `swiftui-layout-components` using `ScrollPosition`, normalized `onScrollGeometryChange` progress, shared continuous effects, discrete settled-state callbacks, scroll arbitration during zoom or crop, and safeguards against geometry feedback loops and broad per-frame invalidation.

## v3.6.1

### Skill updates

- Fix the `core-bluetooth` SwiftUI BLE reference sample so it compiles under Swift 6.3 strict concurrency by keeping delegate callbacks on the `@MainActor` view model when using Core Bluetooth's main-queue `queue: nil` delivery, avoiding `nonisolated` delegate methods that capture non-Sendable Core Bluetooth objects inside `Task { @MainActor }`.

## v3.6.0

### Repository

- Migrate Tessl packaging from deprecated root `tile.json` to `.tessl-plugin/plugin.json`; keep the same 84-skill bundle via explicit skill paths and retain `README.md` as the external public catalog.
- Update the release workflow to publish the Tessl plugin package instead of the deprecated tile package, and verify an already-created registry version when the Tessl publish client times out after the server accepts the upload.
- Bump Tessl plugin and Claude Code marketplace metadata to 3.6.0.
- Promote 248 reviewed Tessl scenarios into the root `evals/` suite for full-project public eval coverage.
- Keep generated Agent Skills workspaces and skill-local generated scenario staging ignored while retaining committed source eval definitions and promoted root scenarios.

### Code example improvements

- Remove ~50 unnecessary hard-coded `spacing:` and `.padding(.direction, N)` values from code examples across 34 skill files. Examples now model the best practice of omitting spacing for adaptive platform defaults. Justified values retained: `spacing: 0` (zero-gap), tight grid gutters (2–4pt), chart API parameters, glass container API, and localization RTL demos.

v1.x had 6 themed bundles + 1 all-skills bundle. v2.0 has 8 themed bundles + 1 all-skills bundle.

Changes:
- `ios-framework-skills` (17 skills) split into `ios-app-framework-skills` (10) and `ios-data-framework-skills` (7).
- New `ios-ai-ml-skills` bundle created with `apple-on-device-ai`, `coreml`, `natural-language`, `speech-recognition`, `vision-framework`.
- AI/ML skills removed from `ios-engineering-skills` and `ios-platform-skills`.
- `ios-platform-skills` trimmed to 5 specialized platform integrations (HomeKit, SharePlay, CallKit, PermissionKit, EnergyKit).
- `ios-engineering-skills` refocused on 10 core engineering skills (networking, security, auth, accessibility, localization, debugging, diagnostics, background processing, device integrity, App Store review).

### Metadata improvements

- All 56 skill descriptions aligned with Agent Skills best practices.
- Bundle descriptions shortened and focused on user intent.
- Missing keywords added for major frameworks (Sendable, async-await, Foundation Models, BLE, Matter, etc.).
- All iOS 26 API claims verified against Apple documentation.

### Beta framework caveats

Three skills reference iOS 26 beta-only frameworks that may change before GM:
- `permissionkit` — PermissionKit (AskCenter, PermissionQuestion, CommunicationLimits)
- `energykit` — EnergyKit (ElectricityGuidance, EnergyVenue)
- `pencilkit-drawing` — references PaperKit integration

### Migration notes

- **Bundle name change**: `ios-framework-skills` no longer exists. Reinstall as `ios-app-framework-skills` and/or `ios-data-framework-skills`.
- **Skill file paths changed**: `swiftui-patterns/references/` files were reorganized during the split into three skills. Tools or scripts referencing old paths will need updating.
- **No breaking API changes**: All skills remain independently installable via `npx skills add` or `/plugin install`.

## v1.1.0

- Remove apple-docs MCP server references from skills.
- Fix npx skills CLI install commands in README.
- Bump plugin versions to 1.1.0.

## v1.0.0

- Initial release with 23 iOS and Swift development skills.
- 6 themed Claude Code plugin bundles + 1 all-skills bundle.
